					<div class="sititle">
						Coffee
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						As a Seattleite, I love coffee. I was a barista for two years and learned a lot about coffee in the meantime. My favorite drink will always be the peppermint black and white mocha (which might mean I like sugar more than coffee).
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sititle">
						Cinematography
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						I love movies! I have a list of <u>394</u> movies that I still want to watch, so I am only a little behind on my list. But I love the artistic aspects of movies, and occasionally some good action as well.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sititle">
						Photography
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						I love taking photos, mainly of nature and other scenic views that I come across.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sititle">
						Tattoos
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						I currently have <u>8</u> tattoos.* All of my tattoos are designed by me, and it usually takes me about 8 months of planning for each tattoo (not to mention the waitlist time for getting a tattoo). <br /> <i>* Tattoo count subject to change without warning</i>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sititle">
						Games
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						I love video, card, and board games, however I do find it a lot harder to cordinate board games. My first console was a PlayStation 2, and my first handheld console was a Gameboy Color.

				Trying to Find What I Love
			</div>

				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						I started off learning Java through a bootcamp to help me learn to program Minecraft plugins for servers.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						Then I really got into web development, teaching myself quite a bit. A couple years later I got into a web development class to better teach me professional protocols.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						A year after I got into a full programming class tought in C# that tought me everything from basic data structures, to rudimentary artificial intelligence. While taking this class, I also took a class in scripting to better my JavaScript abilities, as well as a class in data structures.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						After that, I entered the University of Washington, Bothell where I took a mix of classes in a combination of C++ and Java, with a couple rare classes in Assembly and C.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						Near the end of my university degree, I took a class in parallel and distributed computing (tought in Java), where I fell in love with the aspect of multiple computers working together towards one goal, as well as the beautiful language that is Java.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						I don't know what computer science aspect I want to concentrate my focus on, or what programming language will catch my attention next. But I know that I love learning and will continue to explore the possibilites programming has opened.

						Guitar

						One of the things I am re-learning is the guitar! I worked on learning the guitar when I was 9 and quite recently have been working on picking it up again.

				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sititle">
						Cooking
					</div>
					<div class="sidesc">
						I am decent at following instructions, so I thought I'd try my hand at cooking. I love making foods that interest me, and am working on getting better at the different aspects of making food.

				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						I collect old game systems with my oldest being a 1977 Atari Video Computer System. I have really been a Xbox fan since a kid, and have every single one of their consoles except for the originall Xbox 360, the Xbox Series S and the Xbox Series X.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						I started on PlayStation 2; playing games like SpiderMan, Power Rangers, and Chicken Little; and the GameBoy Color and Advanced; playing almost solely Pokemon games. I moved on to the Wii and then the Xbox 360. From there, I started to branch out into different consoles. I finally settled on building a PC a few years ago, and have found bliss in it since.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						As a kid I loved Pokemon and action games like Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty Black Ops 2. This has transfered over to my current enjoyment of shooter games like Rainbox Six Siege, city games like Cities Skylines, as well as creative games like Minecraft.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						I currently play on Xbox and PC, playing a mix of Cities Skylines, Minecraft, Fallout (3, New Vegas, 4), CS:GO, Call of Duty (Modern Warfare, Black Ops, Warzone), and Tom Clancy's Rainbox Six Siege.

						Although I do have a list with almost 400 movies that I need to watch, I do geniunely enjoy film.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						My two favorite TV shows, that I find myself returning to more than once, are Mr. Robot and Dr. Who. I enjoy the artistic aspects of Mr. Robot and the creative aspects of Dr. Who, but I might also just enjoy shows with honorifics.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionitem">
					<div class="sidesc">
						My top three movies are Baby Driver, American Ultra, and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. I love the artistic components of the movies, mixed with some humor and decent action.
