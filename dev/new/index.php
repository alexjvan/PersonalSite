					Hey there! My full name is Alex<sup>ander</sup> <div>______</div> Van Matre
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I am currently a University of Washington, Bothell student and a service advocate (and master barista) at Target. These are probably the easiest labels to put on me. Maybe minimalist. And nerd...
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					Anyways! I enjoy finding projects that I find challenging, intriguing, or teach me a new skillset. I also enjoy creating solutions to make my life easier and less tedious. Overall, I love programming, creating, and collaborating. But thats all professional.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					For fun, I like to code.<sup>(Shocking, I know)</sup> I'm also a fanatic of cinematography, architecture, and longboarding. And coffee.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I like coffee.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I always have a weird approach to things, straying from the status quo. But who says thats a bad thing? Either way, you should come learn a little more about me.
