					Hey there! My full name is Alex<sup>ander</sup> <div>oh_hi</div> Van Matre
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I am currently a University of Washington, Bothell student and a service advocate (and master barista) at Target. These are probably the easiest labels to put on me. Maybe minimalist. And nerd...
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					Anyways! I enjoy finding projects that I find challenging, intriguing, or teach me a new skillset. I also enjoy creating solutions to make my life easier and less tedious. Overall, I love programming, creating, and collaborating. But thats all professional.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					For fun, I like to code.<sup>(Shocking, I know)</sup> I'm also a fanatic of cinematography, architecture, and longboarding. And coffee.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I like <div>coffee</div>.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I always have a weird approach to things, straying from the status quo. But who says thats a bad thing? Either way, you should come learn a little more about me.

					My toolbox grows with every project
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I like to break up the tools I use into three main categories.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					The first category is obviously programming languages. I have programmed using <div>12 different languages</div>! To be fair, about half of them are web languages, and the other half tend to be more software oriented. But I have used them all the same!
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					The second category are the programs and tools I use to code. This can come in forms of IDEs that I use to write code, all the way to the different management tools that I use to help me administer databases. There tends to be quite a few tools needed to program.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					Last but definitely not least comes all other tools I use. This ranges from software I use for my artwork, all the way to the absolutely wonderful word processor I use for school papers.

					Take a look at my playground
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					I always tend to be working on quite a few projects at once.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					The current projects I work on include a compiler, a Minecraft server, a css library for myself, a project management site, a personalized grabbing system for subreddits, a social media platform, a software system for a system, and a system to help sync my webserver folders with my backup platform. Feel free to throw in what I am working on for school as well.
				</div>
				<div class="bi-p">
					However, my playground includes pretty much <div>every project that I've worked on</div>! (Warning: This is a lot). I won't take too much offense if you filter to only see the ones that interest you.
